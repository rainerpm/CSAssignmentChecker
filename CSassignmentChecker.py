# Demo
#  * unzip demo.zip in a folder on your hard drive
#    - ASSIGNMENT_GROUPS folder
#      > assignment Group folders
#          assignment folders
#             gold.txt
#             ?????Tester.java (optional)  ???? = assignment name
#          periods.txt
#      > comments.txt  (global comments)
#    - 1,4,5 a folder for each class period
#  * set the rootDir variable to the location of the unzipped demo folder
#  * set the validClassPeriods & validClassPeriodsString variables to indicate the class periods
#    you will use this program for (for the demo the class periods are 1,4,5)
#  * run CSassignmentChecker.py
#    - since this is the first time running, the program creates some required directories
#  * You should now see the main menu
#      (1 4 5) manual (a)utojudge (l)og e(x)it (<ENTER>=check)?
#    Enter 1 to have the program enter a mode in which it continually checks for activity for class Period 1
#    (as there is no activity currently, the program will print a . every 2 seconds to let you know it is alive)
#  * A student registers by submitting a file.
#    The file name must conform to the following naming convention - the contents of the file do not matter.
#      #LastFirst????_register.$$
#    where # is the student's class period, ???? is a unique 4 digit code for the student, $$ is either py, java, or zip.
#
#    Ideally students students have a way to "submit" a file directly to a class period folder on your hard drive.
#    This can be achieved by having them submit to an online folder that is automatically synched on your PC -
#    something like the Dropbox File Request feature. However, for this demo instead of students submitting a file to
#    the class Period directory demo/1/ folder, we will instead copy the two files in
#    demo/sampleSubmissions/studentRegistrations/ to demo/1/.  The program
#    (which is still waiting for activity in this directory) detects the two files and
#    registers the students (by creating/updating a file called REGISTER.txt).
#    NOTE:  The demo/5/ and demo/6/ already come with a REGISTER.txt file in the demo.
#  * A student submits their code for an assignment in the same way they register except the "register" in the file name is
#    replaced by the assignment name. The assignment name must match one of the name of one of the
#    assignment folders inside one of the assignment group folders in the ASSIGNMENT_GROUPS folder.
#    Again for the demo, we'll just copy the file demo/sampleSubmissions/studentProblems/1LovelaceAda1234_Collatz.java to demo/1/.
#    This represents the students solution to the collatz assignment. The program tests the student's code for the assignment collatz and compares it to the expected output stored in the test's gold.txt file
#    (demo\ASSIGNMENT_GROUPS\first6weeksAssignments\collatz\gold.txt). In this case the program will report *** CORRECT *** and
#    then bring you to the assignment menu.

#  * To associate an email address with a student manually edit the demo/1/REGISTER.txt file and enter
#    a student email as a 4th field for the student.
#

#
# Run & judge all student assignment that are in a directory for their class on your computer.
# Each assignment is part of an assignment group, that has its own PC2 like scoreboard.
# Currently supports python submissions (.py extension) as well as java (.java,.zip extensions)

# SETUP
#  * set pythonIdeLoc,javaIdeLoc,tkdiffLoc variables below.
#  * Create the main directory for this program and set the rootDir variable to the path of this directory
#  * Set the validclassPeriods variable below to a list of your class periods
#  * Inside the root directory create a class directory for each of your classes in the validclassPeriods variable
#  * Inside each class directory create an assignmentGroup directory named ##_????? (## unique two digit number, ???? = name of assignmentGroup)
#  * Inside each assignmentGroup directory
#    - Create a directory named 00GOLDEN. Inside 00GOLDEN create a directory for each assignment with the name of that assignment.
#      Inside each assigment directory create a file named gold.txt (aka the judge's output file). The student's program output for
#      an assignment will be compared to this gold.txt file using tkdiff.  Also put any input file(s) (aka the judge's data files)
#      that will be read by the student's program into this assignment directory.
#    - For a java assignment create a directory named 00TESTER and put the JAVA test program named TESTER?????.
#      (where ????? is the assignment name). This is the program that will be run to test a student's program.
#  * Create a directory for the scoreboard files and set the scoreboardDir variable to the path of this directory
# RUNNING (TEACHER)
#  Program is run in a timed stamped assignment folder for the student that is inside the assignmentGroup directory in a folder
#  named for the student.
#  After the program runs (or has an error) teacher is prompted with   y/n [i a e s f l](r){x} h=help?
#   'y' submission correct. UPDATE scoreboard, CONTINUE to next submission.
#   'n' submission incorrect. UPDATE scoreboard, CONTINUE to next submission.
#   'i' show the program in IDE.
#   'a' run the program again.
#   'o' print output to screen with \n replaced by â†µ
#   'c' copy information to clipboard (in case email is blocked).
#   'e' email student.
#   'r' remove submitted file. CONTINUE to next submission.
#   's' save submission in 00SAVE directory.
#   'f' print files in student directory.
#   'l' print class log file (chosing l again will get the next earlier set of lines)
#   'x' exit this program (does not remove submitted file).
#   'h' help for menu choices.
# SUBMITTING (STUDENT)
#  Submitted programs must be named ^^(\d+)([a-zA-Z-]+)(\d+)_(.+)\. (e.g. 1LovelaceAda5678_collatz.py)
#   * (\d+) = class ID
#   * ([a-zA-Z-]+) = student name
#   * (\d+) = student code
#   * (.+) = assignment name (all characters between _ and last .

# TODO/IMPROVEMENTS
#   * extract the latest submission from each student into an "assignment directory"
#   * (optionally) sort the program output (for random order JUNIT tests)
#   * (optionally) sort dictionaries
#   * add a 'g' option for grading.  Enter absolute grade or a deduction (how to handle multiple deductions).
#   * multiple tests per assignment (e.g. easy, medium, hard tests)
